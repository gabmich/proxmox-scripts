# proxmox-scripts
Proxmox scripts for VM and containers creation.

## pve-debian-docker.sh
This script is a fork of "docker.sh" (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/community-scripts/ProxmoxVE/main/vm/docker-vm.sh) by thost96 (thost96). Published here : https://community-scripts.github.io/ProxmoxVE/scripts?id=docker. 

Just added possibility to choose keyboard layout (French/Switzerland here) and creation of non-root user with username/password/ssh key.

## more scripts will be added if needed
